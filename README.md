# Pascal's Triangle

## Description
This project implements Pascal's Triangle in Python. The function `pascal_triangle(n)` generates a list of lists representing the triangle for a given number of rows `n`. Each row of Pascal's Triangle contains coefficients that are used in binomial expansions.

## Features
- Generates Pascal's Triangle up to `n` rows.
- Returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the triangle.
- Handles edge cases, such as when `n` is less than or equal to 0.
