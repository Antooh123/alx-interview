# Minimum Operations

This project calculates the minimum number of operations needed to achieve `n` characters using "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## How to Run

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
./0-main.py

# Lockboxes Project

## Description
The Lockboxes project involves solving the "Lockboxes" problem, where you determine if all boxes can be opened given a set of keys in each box. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the first box is already unlocked.

## Problem Statement
You have `n` locked boxes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each box may contain keys to other boxes. Write a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, otherwise return `False`.

### Function Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
# alx-interview
# Pascal's Triangle

## Description
This project implements Pascal's Triangle in Python. The function `pascal_triangle(n)` generates a list of lists representing the triangle for a given number of rows `n`. Each row of Pascal's Triangle contains coefficients that are used in binomial expansions.

## Features
- Generates Pascal's Triangle up to `n` rows.
- Returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the triangle.
- Handles edge cases, such as when `n` is less than or equal to 0.

## Installation
To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
